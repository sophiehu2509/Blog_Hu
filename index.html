      <p>My backgaZround is Mechanical Engineer. The thing that originally drew me to Mechanical
        Engineer is that it is a powerful weapon involved in almost everywhere. I always
        wondered by how things work, fascinated by robots and automobile engines.</p>

        <p>When I pursue my undergraduate degree in 2009, computer is still very strange for most
        people, never to say the web development. But now it is 2018. Internet is awesome. We
        no longer rely physical media to keep connection. The communication becomes easy and the
        obstacles between people has never been so easy to break down. The internet makes life
        simple and convience. It is easy for us to gain and share knowledge, empowering people
        to learn from others and better understand the world.</p>

        <p>I am learning web development and the process of making a website responsive makes me
        happy. I love to change my imagination come to life. And I want to be a web development
        to bring my ideas to life and make a better world.
